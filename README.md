this repo is clearly an example of how to not write a code. but at the same time, the bot was working %80 at the time and it was revolutionary for the growtopia community. unfortunately (or fortunately) people didn't use it so i shut the bot down. so we pivoted it and instead of making automatic middleman, we sell the items directly by creating an e-commerce website called growtopiabuy. the conclusion here, move fast and break things even if you have no clue what are you doing.
